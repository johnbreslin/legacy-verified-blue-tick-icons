Here are some icons I made based on the Twitter Verified Badge, for the Legacy Verified extension at https://github.com/roberrrt-s/legacy-verified-extension.
The source I based them on is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twitter_Verified_Badge.svg which is in the public domain.
I just modified the above (_2.svg/_2.png) to have an actual blue tick and white background. By extension, these too are in the public domain.
